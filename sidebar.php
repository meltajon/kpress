			<p>In West Philadelphia, born and raised, on the playground is where I spent most of my days. Chillin' out back, relaxin', all cool. All shootin' some bball, outside of the school.</p>
			<p>Then a couple of guys, they were up to no good. Started makin' trouble in the neighborhood. I got in one little fight and my mom got scared. She said:</p>
			<blockquote>You're moving with your auntie and your uncle in Bel-Air.</blockquote>
			<p>I whistled for a cab and when it came near, the license said "FRESH" and had a dice in the mirror. If anything I could say that this cab was rare, but I thought nah, forget it, yo homes to Bel-air!</p>
			<p>I pulled up to a house about seven or eight. And I yelled to the cabby "Yo, homes smell you later!" Looked at my kingdom I was finally there. To sit on my throne as the prince of Bel-air</p>
